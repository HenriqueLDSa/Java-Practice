# Java Practice Projects

This repository is a collection of Java practice projects, each designed to focus on different aspects of Java programming, from basic syntax and structures to more complex object-oriented programming concepts. These projects are suitable for beginners and intermediate Java programmers looking to enhance their understanding and skills in Java development.

## Projects Overview

- **Beer-Nutrition-Yearly-main:** Explores operations related to beer nutrition information and yearly statistics, involving classes and object manipulation.
- **Bicycle-List-main:** Manages a list of bicycles, showcasing the use of arrays, custom objects, and menu-driven interfaces for user interaction.
